## What is the problem?

As I've told you in the previous articles, currently I work on UAV project and we're using [ArUco markers]({% post_url 2019-08-08-experiments-with-pose-estimations-and-aruco %}) for precise positioning. Also we're doing horizontal landing, so we have our markers placed on the one internal side of big box. What all this means? Just one thing: after a drone flies out and returns to the box it must get into the place, where it could see the markers. And that is the problem. (#TODO RTK, rangefinders)
