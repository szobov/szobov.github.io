## Background

Some time ago I started to learn new languages. I was always trying to optimize this process using technologies. And since we now have a powerful computer in our pockets I was looking for the software, that can let me extend my vocabulary in a new language.
That how I came to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net). Briefly, it's an application or even a framework, that allows you to create [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) and with a special [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition) algorithm learn effectively (at least for me) new things.

I'm sure everyone has it's own best way to learn new words in a new language, but for me a classical method of just writing words and trying to learn them all at once simply doesn't work. At first it feels like I learned, but all the new knowledge swiftly fade.

I found Anki an amazing tool to solve aforementioned problem.
But the only thing that make me straggle is creating a new deck with flashcards.

Especially after my relocation I started to learn a new language and I wanted to learn words that I see and use in my daily life.
That's how I came up to an idea of using a chat bot, which will help me to add everything I see in my daily life to a deck of flashcards.



## Telegram bot

Motivation:
* I don't like to make UI
* bot already have a framework to build UI
* There is already same bot, but it's not private and relies on online service

## Conclusion

Bot's are nice and easy to distribute. It helped me and my friends to find an apartment in Berlin and also track my life.
Now it will also help me to ease my life in a new country.
