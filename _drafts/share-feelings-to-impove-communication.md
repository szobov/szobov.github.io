## Disclaimer

A few days ago, I returned from a concise journey to my friend in Belgrade.

We spent approximately 90% of our time together speaking about different matters.
So, this article will be the outcome of our discussion. Non-technical, subjective and short.

## Being a human

Working for almost a decade in technical companies, I noticed an essential and rather sad thing: people try to be as optimal as machines, showing no feelings.
We try our best to speak concisely, delivering our intention fast. The problem as I see it is following: we're not machines, we're human and we should rather be proud of it and use it as the advantage.

Let me elaborate on it and provide an example.

## Example

Last week, I woke up in a terrible mood. I had a sleepless night, and I felt broken.

When I opened our team's chat, I noticed a few messages in direct messages. People mostly were asking about my opinion.

I started typing the answers, then realized: "_Hold on, you're definitely providing very negative feedback because you feel broke_".

I tried rewriting my message to be more objective, but it didn't help.

Then, I decided to leave the message as is but add a disclaimer in the beginning:

> 10:03 AM
>
> I just woke up in a bad mood
>
> please divide any of my claims by a factor of 2 at least

and then continued to share my opinion.

I don't know precisely how my colleague reacted to it. At least I provided this person with the knowledge of me being biased not because of the topic this person brought but because of unrelated stuff.

I ho




Of course, it's always better to be unbiased.

But we're all human. We all have bad or good days, which affects our decisions and communications.

What I'm currently working on is trying to detect my mood before I say shitty things. It takes me time because sometimes I just don't notice how fast my mood can deteriorate.
It can be a long and exhausting code review or another call where we argue about something. It's still hard for me to detect my feelings in the moment.
