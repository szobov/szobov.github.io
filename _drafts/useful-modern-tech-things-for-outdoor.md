## Journey

Because of the closed borders due to pandemic, I decided to spend my vocation at the famous Russian mountains -- [Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Mountains). We also wanted to make 2 hikes of 6 days without getting back to any villages or cities. It's not very long hike, but it already requires some things to be well-prepared.
As an engineer I started to look for something modern-tech that could help me, so I decided to share what I found with you.

## Solar charger

6 days in the mountains requires you to have something to charge your devices like smartphone or GPS-receiver. An option here is **power bank**, but if you discharge it, you will have useless weight in your backpack to the end of the hike.
I spent some time lurking internet and found that solar batteries isn't so bad today. It's quite light-weight, powerful and some of them designed to be easily attached to the backpack.
For example, you can look on this list on the **popular mechanics** [site](https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoor-gear/a33022426/best-solar-chargers/). I don't think it's exhaustive list, but it already include some very good models.

Personally, I've bought [this one](https://www.inter-step.ru/catalog/product/solnechnoe_zu_3_paneli_15vt_usb.html) (they have only Russian version of site).

It actually exceeded my expectation, in **sunny weather without too many clouds** it can fully charge **iphone 5se** with ~**2 hours**.
