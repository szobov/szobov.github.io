## Journey

Because of the closed borders due to pandemic, I decided to spend my vocation at the famous Russian mountains -- [Caucasus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasus_Mountains). We also wanted to make 2 hikes of 6 days without getting back to any villages or cities. It's not very long hike, but it already requires some things to be well-prepared.
As an engineer I started to look for something modern-tech that could help me, so I decided to share what I found with you.

## Solar charger

6 days in the mountains requires you to have something to charge your devices like smartphone or GPS-receiver. An option here is **power bank**, but if you discharge it, you will have useless weight in your backpack to the end of the hike.
I spent some time lurking internet and found that solar batteries isn't so bad today. It's quite light-weight, powerful and some of them designed to be easily attached to the backpack.
For example, you can look on this list on the **popular mechanics** [site](https://www.popularmechanics.com/adventure/outdoor-gear/a33022426/best-solar-chargers/). I don't think it's exhaustive list, but it already include some very good models.

Personally, I've bought [this one](https://www.inter-step.ru/catalog/product/solnechnoe_zu_3_paneli_15vt_usb.html) (they have only Russian version of site).

It actually exceeded my expectation, in **sunny weather without too many clouds** it can fully charge **iphone 5se** with ~**2 hours**. Just put in on top of your backpack, fasten and go.

Of course it will work only for places with at least few hours without clouds. For example, I won't take it to Norway's hikes where the sun never shines. :)

## Accumulators

It's mountain's hike, so there is no artificial light, only this you've brought with you. Most likely you will use the [headlamps](https://www.theadventurejunkies.com/brightest-headlamps/).
Headlamps are super-cool, but the problem is the same as with smartphones, it's accumulators. There are a lot of headlamps with AA or AAA batteries. But I don't really like the idea of normal batteries, because it's very difficult to recycle it, particularly in Russia. I decided to search the web and found this [rechargeable batteries](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32983512561.html) with capacity 3000 mAh. And again, it was beyond my expectations because 2 batteries were enough for 12 days. Of course, we used headlamps only on evenings and nights, but still it's great value.
