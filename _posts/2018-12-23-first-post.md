* content
{:toc}

Hey, I've decided to start write my own blog. As many people, I'll use it as my dairy to save a pieces of my experience. Maybe someone can find here something useful and interesting.

On a first glance Github Pages looks like a perfect place to do a blog: auto-deployment, markdown, version control system and already prepared themes. Hope I'll pay all my attention only on blog content not on the any site processes.

> English, MF, do you speak it?

Unfortunately, I've chosen English for blog, but it's not my main language. It means that here is would be the tons of typos, but I hope I'll improve it with a time. If you found any, you can make a pull request with the fixes, I'll appreciate it.

Have a great time!
